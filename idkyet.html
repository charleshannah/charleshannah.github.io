	<h4 class="one"> What are the effects of global warming?</h4>
	 <h2 style="color: black;">The effects of global warming or climate damage include far-reaching and long-lasting changes to the natural environment, to ecosystems and human societies caused directly or indirectly by human emissions of greenhouse gases. It also includes the economic and social changes which stem from living in a warmer world.</h2>
	  <h3 class="two">Some of these changes include:</h3>

	  	       <li class="three">More frequent and severe weather</li>
	  	       <li>Higher temperatures are worsening many types of disasters,</li><li> including storms, heat waves, floods, and droughts.</li><li> A warmer climate creates an atmosphere that can collect,</li><li> retain, and drop more water, changing weather patterns in such a</li><li> way that wet areas become wetter and dry areas drier.</li>

	  	       <li class="three">Higher death rates</li>
	  	       <li>Today's scientists point to climate change as</li><li> "the biggest global health threat of the 21st century."</li><li> It's a threat that impacts all of us especially children,</li><li> the elderly, low-income communities, and minorities</li><li>and in a variety of direct and indirect ways.</li><li> As temperatures spike, so does the incidence of illness,</li><li> emergency room visits, and death.</li>

	  	       <li class="three">Dirtier air</li>
	  	       <li>Rising temperatures also worsen air pollution by</li><li> increasing ground level ozone, which is created when pollution from cars,</li><li> factories, and other sources react to sunlight and heat.</li><li> Ground-level ozone is the main component of smog,</li><li> and the hotter things get, the more of it we have.</li><li> Dirtier air is linked to higher hospital admission rates</li><li> and higher death rates for asthmatics.</li><li> It worsens the health of people suffering from cardiac or pulmonary disease.</li><li> And warmer temperatures also significantly increase airborne pollen,</li><li> which is bad news for those who suffer from hay fever and other allergies.</li>

	  	       <li class="three">More acidic oceans</li>
	  	       <li>The earth's marine ecosystems are under pressure as a result of climate change.</li><li> Oceans are becoming more acidic, due in large part to their absorption of some of our</li><li> excess emissions. As this acidification accelerates,</li><li> it poses a serious threat to underwater life, particularly creatures with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons,</li><li> including mollusks, crabs, and corals. This can have a huge impact on shellfisheries.</li>
